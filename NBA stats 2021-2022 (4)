# In this excercise, I rank players by their efficiency rating. Before we start, it is worth mentioning that for players who have moved teams, the "TOT" value 
  under "Team" column represents total of the stats for the season. For example, if a player switched team from New York to Chicago, there will be 3 rows for 
  the player, one for New York, one for Chicago, and one for total of the stats.
